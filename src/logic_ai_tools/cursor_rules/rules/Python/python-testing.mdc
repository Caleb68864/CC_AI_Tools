# Python Testing Rules

<rule>
name: python_testing
description: Standards for testing Python code

## Unit Testing
- Write tests for critical code paths
- Use appropriate testing frameworks (unittest, pytest)
- Test edge cases and boundary conditions
- Maintain high test coverage

## Test Organization
- Group related tests together
- Use clear test names
- Follow arrange-act-assert pattern
- Keep tests independent

## Test Quality
- Write readable tests
- Avoid test interdependence
- Mock external dependencies
- Test both success and failure cases

examples:
  - input: |
      # Good
      def test_calculate_total_price():
          # Arrange
          items = [{"price": 10}, {"price": 20}]
          
          # Act
          result = calculate_total_price(items)
          
          # Assert
          assert result == 30
</rule>
