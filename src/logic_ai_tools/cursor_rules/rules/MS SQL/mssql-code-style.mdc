      Follow these code style guidelines:

      1. Keywords and Formatting:
         - Use consistent capitalization for keywords (UPPERCASE recommended)
         - Break complex queries into logical chunks with line breaks
         - Indent subqueries and CTEs
         - Align column lists and conditions for readability

      2. Aliasing:
         - Use meaningful table aliases
         - Keep aliases short but descriptive
         - Always qualify column names with table aliases in joins

      3. Whitespace:
         - Use indentation for nested queries
         - Add line breaks between logical sections
         - Include spaces around operators
         - One blank line between statements

examples:
  - input: |
      -- Bad
      select a.customerid,a.name,b.orderdate from customers a join orders b on a.customerid=b.customerid where a.status='active'
      
      -- Good
      SELECT 
          c.CustomerId,
          c.Name,
          o.OrderDate
      FROM 
          Customers c
          INNER JOIN Orders o ON c.CustomerId = o.CustomerId
      WHERE 
          c.Status = 'Active'
