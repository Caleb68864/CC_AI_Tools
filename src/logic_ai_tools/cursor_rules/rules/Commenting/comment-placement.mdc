name: comment_placement
description: Guidelines for positioning different types of comments

placement_rules:
- Inline Comments: Same line as code for clarifying tricky logic
- Block Comments: Above methods or classes for high-level explanations
- Documentation Comments: Before public methods, classes, and properties

examples:
  - input: |
      // Good: Block comment explaining class purpose
      /**
       * Handles user authentication and session management
       */
      class AuthManager {
          
          x = 5; // Good: Inline comment explaining tricky value
      }
</rule>
