description: Guidelines for keeping comments current and useful

maintenance_rules:
- Update or remove comments when code changes
- Avoid speculative comments about future changes
- Remove outdated comments promptly
- Use examples when explaining complex logic
- Strive for self-documenting code over excessive comments

examples:
  - input: |
      // Bad: Speculative comment
      function process() {
          // TODO: Maybe add validation in the future
      }
      
      // Good: Current, specific comment
      function process() {
          // NOTE: Input validation handled by upstream service
      }
</rule>
