description: Core rules for writing effective code comments

principles:
- Keep comments concise and avoid over-explaining
- Use proper grammar and spelling
- Avoid redundant comments that state the obvious
- Focus on explaining why, not what
- Stay professional and avoid jokes or personal remarks

examples:
  - input: |
      // Bad: Redundant comment
      x = x + 1; // Increment x by 1
      
      // Good: Explains the why
      x = x + 1; // Compensate for zero-based indexing
</rule>
