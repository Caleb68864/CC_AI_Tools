      Follow the recommended Flask project structure:
      
      ```
      project/
      ├── app/
      │   ├── __init__.py
      │   ├── models/
      │   ├── views/
      │   ├── templates/
      │   └── static/
      ├── tests/
      ├── config.py
      ├── requirements.txt
      └── run.py
      ```
      
      Key principles:
      1. Separate concerns into different modules
      2. Use blueprints for feature organization
      3. Keep configuration separate
      4. Include tests directory

examples:
  - input: |
      # All code in a single file
      app.py
    output: |
      Properly structured Flask project with separated concerns
