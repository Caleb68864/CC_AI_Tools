      When working with DataView:

      1. Query Structure:
         - Position cursor after query block completion
         - Place cursor at next filter position
         - Maintain consistent query formatting

      2. Metadata Fields:
         - Position cursor after field completion
         - Group related fields together
         - Place cursor at next field entry point

      3. Query Types:
         - LIST: Position cursor at next filter
         - TABLE: Align column specifications
         - TASK: Group related task queries
         - CALENDAR: Include required date field

      4. Data Commands:
         - FROM: Start with source specification
         - WHERE: Align filter conditions
         - SORT: Group sort criteria
         - GROUP BY: Maintain grouping hierarchy

examples:
  - input: |
      ```dataview
      TABLE field
      FROM "source"|  # Bad - blocks query editing
      ```
      
      ```dataview
      TABLE field
      FROM "source"
      ```
      |  # Good - ready for next query
    output: "Proper cursor positioning for DataView queries"
