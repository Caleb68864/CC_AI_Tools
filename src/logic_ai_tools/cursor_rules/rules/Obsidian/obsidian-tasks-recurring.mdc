      When working with recurring tasks:

      1. Basic Syntax:
         - Use 🔁 to mark a task as recurring
         - Must start with "every"
         - Must have at least one date (due 📅, scheduled ⏳, or start 🛫)
         - Example: `- [ ] take out trash 🔁 every Sunday 📅 2024-02-25`

      2. Common Recurrence Patterns:
         - Days: `🔁 every 3 days`
         - Weeks: `🔁 every week on Sunday`
         - Weekdays: `🔁 every weekday` (Mon-Fri)
         - Multiple days: `🔁 every week on Tuesday, Friday`
         - Months: `🔁 every month on the 1st`
         - Years: `🔁 every year`

      3. Advanced Patterns:
         - Last day of month: `🔁 every month on the last`
         - Specific months: `🔁 every January on the 15th`
         - Multiple months: `🔁 every April and December on the 1st and 24th`
         - Nth weekday: `🔁 every month on the last Friday`
         - Multiple intervals: `🔁 every 2 weeks`, `🔁 every 3 months`

      4. Completion Behavior:
         - Default: New task based on original dates
         - When done: `🔁 every week when done` (bases next date on completion)
         - New task appears above completed task by default
         - All dates maintain relative distance to reference date

      5. Important Limitations:
         - Must have at least one date field
         - Don't use in daily notes (creates duplicate tasks)
         - Cannot recur for X times or until specific date
         - Dependencies (id and dependsOn) are removed in next recurrence
         - Monthly/yearly tasks adjust for invalid dates (e.g., Feb 30)

examples:
  - input: |
      # Basic recurring task
      - [ ] Water plants 🔁 every 3 days 📅 2024-02-25

      # Task with relative scheduling
      - [ ] Review notes 🔁 every week when done ⏳ 2024-02-26 📅 2024-02-28

      # Monthly task on last day
      - [ ] Pay rent 🔁 every month on the last 📅 2024-02-29

      # Multiple weekdays
      - [ ] Team meeting 🔁 every week on Monday, Wednesday 🛫 2024-02-26
  - output: "Properly formatted recurring tasks with various patterns"
