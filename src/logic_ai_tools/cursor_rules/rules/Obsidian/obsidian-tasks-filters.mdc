      When filtering tasks in queries:

      1. Date Filters:
         - Single Date Format:
           - `(due|scheduled|starts|happens) (on|before|after|on or before|on or after) <date>`
           - `<date>` can be:
             - Absolute: `YYYY-MM-DD`
             - Relative: `today`, `tomorrow`, `next monday`, `in two weeks`
         - Date Range Format:
           - `(due|scheduled|starts|happens) (in|before|after|in or before|in or after) <date range>`
           - `<date range>` can be:
             - Absolute: `YYYY-MM-DD YYYY-MM-DD`
             - Relative: `last|this|next week|month|quarter|year`
             - Numbered: `YYYY-Www`, `YYYY-mm`, `YYYY-Qq`, `YYYY`

      2. Status Filters:
         - Basic: `done`, `not done`
         - Status Type: `status.type (is|is not) (TODO|DONE|IN_PROGRESS|CANCELLED|NON_TASK)`
         - Status Name: `status.name (includes|does not include) <string>`

      3. Text and Description Filters:
         - Basic: `description (includes|does not include) <string>`
         - Regex: `description (regex matches|regex does not match) /<pattern>/`
         - Heading: `heading (includes|does not include) <string>`

      4. Priority and Tags:
         - Priority: `priority is (above|below|not)? (lowest|low|none|medium|high|highest)`
         - Tags: 
           - Basic: `tags (include|do not include) <tag>`
           - Presence: `has tags`, `no tags`
           - Regex: `tags (regex matches|regex does not match) /<pattern>/`

      5. File Location Filters:
         - Path: `path (includes|does not include) <path>`
         - Folder: `folder (includes|does not include) <folder>`
         - Root: `root (includes|does not include) <root>`
         - Filename: `filename (includes|does not include) <filename>`

      6. Boolean Combinations:
         - Combine with `AND` (implicit between lines)
         - Use `(filter1) OR (filter2)` for alternatives
         - Use `NOT`, `AND NOT`, `OR NOT`, `XOR`
         - Example: `(no due date) OR (due after today)`

      7. Important Notes:
         - All text matches are case-insensitive unless using regex
         - Regex searches are case-sensitive by default
         - Date ranges are inclusive of start and end dates
         - Use `explain` in query to debug unexpected results

examples:
  - input: |
      ```tasks
      not done
      (due today) OR (scheduled before tomorrow)
      path includes Projects
      tags include #priority
      ```

      ```tasks
      not done
      due this week
      heading includes Daily Review
      priority is above none
      ```

      ```tasks
      (status.type is TODO) OR (status.type is IN_PROGRESS)
      folder includes Work/Projects
      description includes deadline
      ```
  - output: "Properly formatted Tasks plugin queries with various filters"
