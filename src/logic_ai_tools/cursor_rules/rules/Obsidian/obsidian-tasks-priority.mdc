      # Validate priority emoji format
      - pattern: "^[-\\*\\+]\\s*\\[\\s?\\].*[‚è´‚è¨Ô∏èüîºüîΩüî∫]\\s*[‚è´‚è¨Ô∏èüîºüîΩüî∫]"

        message: "Use priority emojis (üî∫‚è´üîºüîΩ‚è¨Ô∏è) instead of text for priorities"

examples:
  - input: |
      - [ ] ‚è´ High priority task at start
      - [ ] Multiple üîº üîΩ priorities
      - [ ] Task with high priority text
      - [ ] Task with invalid priority placement‚è´ here
      priority is greater highest
      group by priority reversed
  - output: |
      - [ ] High priority task ‚è´
      - [ ] Task üîº
      - [ ] Task ‚è´
      - [ ] Task ‚è´
      priority is above highest
      group by priority

metadata:
  priority: high
  version: 1.0

notes: |
  Priority Rules:
  1. Priority order (highest to lowest): üî∫ > ‚è´ > üîº > (no priority) > üîΩ > ‚è¨Ô∏è
  2. Tasks without priority are considered between low and medium priority
  3. Only one priority signifier per task
  4. Priority should be at the end of the task description
  5. Use Tasks plugin commands or auto-suggest for adding priorities
  6. Valid priority comparisons use 'above' or 'below' with priority levels
  7. Priority levels: highest, high, none, medium, low, lowest
  8. Properties available: priorityNumber, priorityName, priorityNameGroupText
