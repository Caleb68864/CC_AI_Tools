      When positioning cursors in Obsidian:

      1. Efficiency First:
         - Position cursor to minimize keystrokes
         - Avoid unnecessary cursor movements
         - Place cursor where the next likely edit will occur

      2. Context Awareness:
         - Cursor should adapt to the current template type
         - Consider the natural flow of note-taking
         - Respect Vim mode navigation patterns

examples:
  - input: |
      # Header
      |Content  # Bad - requires down movement
      
      # Header
      
      |Content  # Good - natural flow
    output: "Proper cursor positioning following efficiency principles"
