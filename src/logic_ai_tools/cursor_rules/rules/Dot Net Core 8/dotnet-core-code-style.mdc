      When writing .NET code:

      1. Code Style:
         - Write concise, idiomatic C# code
         - Follow .NET and ASP.NET Core conventions
         - Use object-oriented and functional patterns appropriately
         - Prefer LINQ and lambda expressions for collections
         - Use descriptive names (e.g., 'IsUserSignedIn', 'CalculateTotal')

      2. File Structure:
         - Organize by .NET conventions (Controllers, Models, Services)
         - Group related functionality together
         - Maintain consistent file organization

      3. C# Features:
         - Use C# 10+ features when appropriate
         - Leverage built-in ASP.NET Core features
         - Use Entity Framework Core effectively

examples:
  - input: |
      // Bad
      public bool chk() { return usr != null; }

      // Good
      public bool IsUserSignedIn() 
      {
          return currentUser != null;
      }
