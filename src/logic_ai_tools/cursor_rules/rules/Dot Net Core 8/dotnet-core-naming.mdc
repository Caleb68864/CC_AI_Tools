      Follow these naming conventions:

      1. Case Conventions:
         - PascalCase: class names, method names, public members
         - camelCase: local variables, private fields
         - UPPERCASE: constants
         
      2. Prefixes:
         - Interface names: "I" (e.g., 'IUserService')
         - Private Class variables: "_" (e.g., _dataService)
         - Database Context: always "_db"

      3. General Guidelines:
         - Use descriptive, meaningful names
         - Avoid abbreviations unless widely known
         - Keep names concise but clear

examples:
  - input: |
      // Bad
      private userSvc _UserService;
      
      // Good
      private IUserService _userService;
