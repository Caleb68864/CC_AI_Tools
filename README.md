# CC AI Tools
Productivity Tools Using AI

## Installation

First, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Caleb68864/CC_AI_Tools
cd CCAITools
```

Install the package and its dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install .
```

For development installation with editable mode:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

### PowerShell Setup (Windows)

Run the included PowerShell installation script to set up command-line aliases and environment files:

**Note:** You may need to run this script with administrator privileges.

```powershell
# Standard installation (pulls Production branch)
.\install_Scripts.ps1

# Development mode (skips Production branch)
.\install_Scripts.ps1 -dev
# or
.\install_Scripts.ps1 -d
```

This script will:
- By default, checkout and pull the latest Production branch (skip with -dev flag)
- Create global PowerShell functions for all Python scripts, allowing them to run from any location
- Automatically set up `.env` files from `.env.example` templates if they don't exist
- Enable you to run scripts by their name without the `.py` extension (e.g., `CreateGitCommitMsg` instead of `python CreateGitCommitMsg.py`)

### Setup

The PowerShell installation script (`install_Scripts.ps1`) will automatically create a `.env` file from `.env.example` if it doesn't exist. You can then edit the `.env` file with your settings:

**Required API Keys:**
- `API_KEY=your_api_key_here` (deprecated)
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_claude_api_key_here`
- `GIT_USERNAME=your_username` (for branch naming)

**Optional AI Model Settings:**
- `CLAUDE_SMALL_MODEL=claude-3-haiku-20240307`
- `CLAUDE_MEDIUM_MODEL=claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620`
- `CLAUDE_LARGE_MODEL=claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620`

The AI model settings allow you to specify which Claude models to use for different tasks. If not set, the scripts will use default values.

  Scans your current Git branch and staged changes to gather context.
- **Intelligent commit messages**  
  Uses Claude AI to parse file diffs and create concise, action-oriented messages.
- **Structured formatting**  
  Splits commit text into a short title, summary (the "why"), and details (the "what/how").
- **Smart file staging**  
  Preserves already staged changes and offers selective staging of additional files.
- **Interactive commit + push**  
  Optionally push your changes immediately after reviewing the AI-generated message.
- **Commit history logging**  
  Stores commit message logs (with timestamps) to keep a personal record of generated messages.

---

1. **Title line under 50 characters**  
   - Starts with a capital verb (e.g., "Add," "Fix," "Update").
2. **Summary section**  
   - Explains the "why" in 2‚Äì3 sentences.
3. **Details section**  
   - Uses bullet points for key technical changes or additional info.
4. **Files Changed**  
   - Mentions changed files, grouped logically and explained briefly.
5. **Smart File Staging**  
   - Detects already staged changes and asks if you want to keep or add to them
   - Displays numbered lists of unstaged files for easy selection
   - Supports selective staging through individual numbers or ranges (e.g., `1`, `1,3`, `2-4`)
   - Defaults to staging all files if no specific selection is provided
6. **User Prompt**  
   - Allows you to add extra context for the AI to incorporate into the commit message.
7. **Interactive Approval**  
   - Prompts you to "approve or reject" the AI-generated commit text before actually committing.
8. **Optional Push**  
   - If you approve, you can also push to remote in the same workflow.

---


#### Usage

You can stage your changes before running the script, or let the script help you stage files:

Run the script:

```bash
python CreateGitCommitMsg.py
```

Or if you have a direct alias or console script set up:

```bash
CreateGitCommitMsg
```

- If you have already staged changes, the script will:
  - Show you the list of staged files
  - Ask if you want to work with these files or stage additional ones
  - If you choose to stage more, it will display unstaged files with numbers for selection

- If no files are staged yet, the script will:
  - Show you a list of all unstaged files with numbers
  - Let you select specific files by entering numbers or ranges (e.g., `1`, `1,3`, `2-4`)
  - Stage all files if you just press Enter without selecting any

- Enter your own commit context (e.g., "Refactor login logic for clarity").
- The script:
  - Analyzes your staged changes,
  - Sends the diff to Claude AI for analysis,
  - Returns a formatted commit message (with Title, Summary, and Details).
- Review the message displayed in the console.
- If you confirm "y", it commits with that message and optionally pushes.
- If you decline "n", it aborts and lets you try again or exit.

#### Example

**File Staging**

```plaintext
üìù Analyzing changes...
üîç Found 2 already staged files:
  1. src/auth.py
  2. src/login_utils.py

Do you want to work with these staged files? (Y/n): n

üìã Unstaged files (3):
  1. src/config.py
  2. src/utils.py
  3. README.md

üî¢ Enter file numbers to stage (e.g., '1,3,5-7', or press Enter for all): 1,3
üìå Staging 2 additional files...
‚úÖ Files staged successfully.
```

**User Prompt**

```plaintext
Enter Your Commit Message: Refactor login flow, remove unused functions
```

**AI-Generated Commit Message might look like:**

```plaintext
Refactor login flow

Summary:
Streamline the login process by removing redundant calls and
improving error-handling for failed authentications.

Details:
- Removed duplicate validation methods
- Updated error messages in auth helpers
- Deleted unused login_utils.py functions

Files Changed:
- auth.py: consolidated login checks
- login_utils.py: removed deprecated methods
```

The script shows you this commit text, and asks:

```plaintext
‚úã Do you want to commit with this message? (y/n):
```

Approve with "y" to commit, then it prompts:

```plaintext
üöÄ Do you want to push these changes? (y/n):
```

If you choose "y", it pushes your branch to remote.

### CreateGitProgressReport.py

Below is detailed documentation for the Git Progress Report Generator script.

#### Overview

This Python script analyzes Git commits since the last run and generates a structured progress report, leveraging Anthropic's Claude AI to categorize commit messages by type and scope. It is especially useful for summarizing changes at the end of a sprint or for daily standups.

#### Features

- Tracks last run time per repository + branch (using `last_run.yaml`).
- Analyzes commit messages with Claude AI to extract a short summary, change type, scope, files changed, and impact level.
- Organizes commits by type (feat/fix/refactor/docs/style/test/chore) and scope.
- Generates a concise, bullet-pointed report ready for standups or release notes.
- Optional clipboard copy of the final report.

#### Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- `gitpython`, `pyperclip`, `python-dotenv`, `pyyaml`, `anthropic`
- A `.env` file containing `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_claude_api_key_here`.

#### Usage

- Run the script within a Git repository (so it can detect commits on the active branch).

  ```bash
  CreateGitProgressReport
  ```

- The script finds commits since your last run (or 3 AM of the current day if no prior run is recorded).
- A report is displayed in the terminal.
- You can copy the final report to your clipboard by pressing "y" when prompted; pressing "n" keeps it in the console only.
- If you approve and copy the report, the script updates your `last_run.yaml` to record the new run time. If not, the run time remains unchanged.

#### Command-Line Arguments

| Argument               | Short Flag | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--recent-commits [N]` | `-rc [N]`  | Interactively select a commit from the last N commits (default 5). You can then analyze all commits after that point. |
| `--since "DATE/TIME"`  | `-s "DATE/TIME"` | Start date/time (e.g. "2025-01-01", "2025-01-01 14:30:00")                  |
| `--until "DATE/TIME"`  | `-u "DATE/TIME"` | End date/time (default is now)                                              |
| `--date "DATE"`        | `-d "DATE"` | Shorthand for --since; sets a start date (e.g. "2025-01-01")                |

Dates/times are parsed in multiple common formats (e.g. YYYY-MM-DD, MM/DD/YYYY, with optional times).

#### Examples

- Use default since-last-run

  ```bash
  CreateGitProgressReport
  ```

  or:

  ```bash
  python CreateGitProgressReport.py
  ```

- Select from the last 10 commits

  ```bash
  CreateGitProgressReport --recent-commits 10
  ```

  The script displays commit titles, lets you pick one as a starting point, then summarizes everything after it.

- Specify an explicit date range

  ```bash
  CreateGitProgressReport --since "2025-01-01" --until "2025-01-31"
  ```

  or, using short flags:

  ```bash
  CreateGitProgressReport -s "2025-01-01" -u "2025-01-31"
  ```

#### How It Works

- Determines the 'start date/time' (from `--recent-commits`, `--since`, `--date`, or `last_run.yaml`).
- Pulls commits from `start_datetime` to `end_datetime`.
- Sends commit data (message + file stats) to Claude AI for analysis.
- Groups commits by type and scope.
- Generates a concise, AI-written bullet-list of changes.
- Prompts to copy the summary to clipboard and updates `last_run.yaml` if confirmed.

#### YAML Storage (last_run.yaml)

- Stored beside the script.
- Tracks the last run time per `[repo]_[branch]`.
- Updated after a successful run (if you choose to copy the report).

### CreateGitBranchName.py

A Python script that uses Claude AI (Anthropic) to generate **standardized** and **descriptive** Git branch names. It enforces best practices like consistent naming conventions, date prefixes, and concise descriptions. The script now supports personalized branch naming with usernames and provides AI-powered fallback options.

---

#### Overview

- **Generates 5 branch name suggestions** based on a user-provided description
- **Allows custom branch creation** with user-selected type and description
- **Ensures naming convention compliance** (kebab-case, type prefix, 50-char max length)
- **Automatically adds a date prefix** (e.g. `YYYY/MM/DD-HHMM-username-feat-branch-description`)
- **Integrates with Claude AI** to produce clear, well-structured suggestions
- **Provides an interactive selection** to create a new Git branch directly
- **Username Integration** for consistent branch ownership tracking
- **Smart AI Fallback** when username is not configured

---

#### Features

1. **Kebab-case format**  
   Lowercase letters and hyphens only.  
2. **Username Integration**  
   - Reads username from `.env` file (`GIT_USERNAME`)
   - Automatically formats username for branch naming
   - Prompts for username if not found or blank
   - Updates `.env` file with provided username
3. **AI Fallback System**  
   - Provides AI-generated branch names if username is not set
   - Maintains consistent naming structure even without username
   - Can switch between personal and AI-generated formats
4. **Prefixed by type**  
   (`feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `style`, `test`, `hotfix`)  
5. **Short branch descriptions**  
   Under 50 characters (including the type)  
6. **Date stamping**  
   Adds `YYYY/MM/DD-HHMM-` to the front of the final branch name  
7. **Custom branch creation**  
   Choose your own branch type and description without using AI suggestions
8. **Graceful error handling**  
   - Detects non-Git folders
   - Prevents creating a branch if it already exists
   - Handles invalid input selections
   - Provides options to try again, switch methods, or quit

---

#### Usage

Place the script (e.g. CreateGitBranchName.py) in your project or somewhere on your PATH.

In a Git repository, run the script:

```bash
python CreateGitBranchName.py
```

Or if you have a direct alias/console script set up:

```bash
CreateGitBranchName
```

**Username Configuration**
- The script checks for `GIT_USERNAME` in your `.env` file
- If not found or blank, you'll be prompted to enter your username
- Usernames are automatically formatted for branch naming (lowercase, no spaces)
- Your username is saved to `.env` for future use

**Option 1: AI-Generated Suggestions**
- Choose option 1 (default) when prompted
- Enter a short description of your changes or feature
- View suggestions (the script prints five possible branch names)
- Select a branch by number (1‚Äì5) or choose option 6 to create a custom branch instead
- Confirm the final branch name with date and username prefix
- Optionally push to remote

**Option 2: Custom Branch Creation**
- Choose option 2 when prompted
- Select a branch type from the list (feat, fix, refactor, docs, style, test, hotfix)
- Enter a description for your branch
- Confirm the final branch name with date and username prefix
- Optionally push to remote

```plaintext
üìù Checking username configuration...
‚ùì Username not found in .env file. Please enter your username: johndoe
‚úÖ Username saved to .env file

üîÑ Branch Creation Options:
1. Generate AI suggestions based on description (default)
2. Create custom branch name

üîñ Select an option (1/2, default: 1): 2

Available branch types:
==================================================
1. feat
2. fix
3. refactor
4. docs
5. style
6. test
7. hotfix
==================================================

üîñ Select a branch type (enter number): 1

üìù Enter a description for your feat branch: user authentication system

ü§î Create new branch '2024/03/20-1423-johndoe-feat-user-authentication-system' from 'main'? (Y/n):
```

If you don't confirm the branch name, you'll be presented with options to:
- Try creating a custom branch again
- Use AI suggestions instead
- Quit the script

#### Implementation Details

- **AI Prompt**: Sends a system prompt to Claude specifying rules for the branch name format.
- **YAML Parsing**: The AI response is expected in strict YAML, which is parsed using `pyyaml`.
- **GitPython**: Used to check if the current directory is a valid Git repo and create the new branch if requested.
- **Date Prefix**: The script automatically calculates `YYYY/MM/DD-HHMM-` and prepends it to the branch name.
- **Error Handling**:
  - If a branch name already exists, the script notifies you and does not overwrite it.
  - If any issue arises in parsing the AI output, it logs the raw response for troubleshooting.

## Cursor IDE

### ApplyCursorRules.py

A Python script that manages Cursor IDE rules for your project, allowing you to selectively apply coding standards, documentation requirements, and other development guidelines.

#### Overview

- **Interactive Rule Selection** via a searchable GUI interface

   - Preserves custom rule modifications
   - Compatible with version control systems

#### Usage

Run the script from your project's root directory:

```bash
python ApplyCursorRules.py
```

Or if you have the alias set up:

```bash
ApplyCursorRules
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Always run this script from your project's root directory (where your `.git` folder is located). This ensures that:
- Rules are installed in the correct `.cursor` directory
- All project files can access the rules
- Version control properly tracks rule changes

1. A window appears showing available rules grouped by category
2. Use the search box to filter rules by name
3. Select/deselect individual rules or entire categories
4. Click "Confirm Selection" to apply changes
5. Review the summary of added/removed rules

#### Example Output

```plaintext
Rules copied successfully to: /your/project/.cursor/rules

Added rules:
  ‚Ä¢ comment-maintenance.mdc
  ‚Ä¢ code-style.mdc

Removed rules:
  ‚Ä¢ old-standard.mdc
```

The script maintains a clean, organized rule structure while preserving history of removed rules in case you need to reference them later.
